Latin to English translator. Well it is limited to one word at a time and shows it's definitions instead of a translation, so I guess it would be best described as an automated dictionary tooltip of sorts.

- [Firefox's extensions place](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/latin-english-dictionary/)

I use this [API](https://latinwordnet.exeter.ac.uk/) to check each word's base form.
I use this two dictionaries to get needed definitions.
